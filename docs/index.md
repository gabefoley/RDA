# Retrieval of Database Annotations

[Retreivel of Database Annotations](https://mkdocs.org) is part of [GRASP-suite](https://grasp.scmb.uq.edu.au).

It is designed to add annotations from online databases to sets of protein sequences, in order for these annotations to be used within the ancestral sequence reconstruction program [GRASP](https://grasp.scmb.uq.edu.au).

## Basic operations

### UniProt annotations
* Upload a FASTA file with your protein sequences of interest
* Select the [UniProt database fields](https://www.uniprot.org/help/uniprotkb_column_names) you wish to add to your annotation file
* Download your annotation file and upload it into your chose reconstruction in [GRASP](https://grasp.scmb.uq.edu.au).

### BRENDA annotations
* Go to [BRENDA database](https://www.brenda-enzymes.org) and search for the enzyme or ligand of interest.
* At the bottom of this page, scroll down to the very bottom and select 
    * Download
    * BRENDA Textfile
* Upload this BRENDA annotations file (this is what is parsed by RDA)

### Combining annotations
It is fine to add annotations from multiple databases
